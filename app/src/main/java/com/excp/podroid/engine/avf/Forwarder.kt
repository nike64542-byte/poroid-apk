 * reaper loops). `Dispatchers.IO` caps at 64 threads; one rule parks one
 * thread there for its whole lifetime, so past 64 rules the blocking loops
 * alone would exhaust the pool and starve every other IO user in the app.
 * A cached thread pool has no such cap - idle threads are reclaimed, busy
 * ones aren't capped.
 *
 * Per-connection/per-flow pump coroutines are NOT moved here: their
 * concurrency is bounded by real traffic (MAX_INFLIGHT / MAX_FLOWS) rather
 * than by rule count, so `Dispatchers.IO` remains the right fit for them.
 *
 * Lazily created on first forwarder start, shut down by AvfEngine.cleanup()
 * alongside the forwarders it backs; the next VM start recreates it on demand.
